//! The built-in **signature database**: command/environment argument shapes plus
//! the semantic metadata a formatter/linter needs (sectioning level,
//! verbatim-ness, math-ness). This is the place where *meaning* is assigned to
//! names, kept strictly out of the parser (AGENTS.md decision #2).
//!
//! The data is fully static, so it lives in a process-wide [`LazyLock`],
//! consulted directly. Per-file `\newcommand`/`\newenvironment`/xparse
//! signatures are scanned by [`super::define`] into a separate, per-document
//! [`SignatureDb`] and overlaid via [`Signatures`] (scanned-first, built-in
//! fallback); the greedy parser's argument attachment is unaffected either way. A
//! salsa input only becomes necessary once that overlay must be cached across
//! queries (a later item, when an LSP consumer appears).
//!
//! ## Source of truth: one granular JSON file
//!
//! The built-in data is a single curated JSON file (`data/signatures.json`,
//! [`include_str!`]-ed, [`serde`]-deserialized) holding *all* the metadata in one
//! typed place — argument shapes *and* sectioning level / verbatim-ness /
//! math-ness together, keyed by name. This is the high-precision tier we maintain
//! by hand.
//!
//! Lower-precision external sources layer *underneath* this, ingested into the
//! same schema rather than replacing it. The TeXstudio/Kile **CWL corpus** is one
//! such tier: a
//! converter (`scripts/gen_cwl_signatures.py`) harvests command/environment names
//! and argument shapes from a curated package subset into `data/cwl_signatures.json`,
//! exposed by [`cwl`] and consulted *under* [`builtin`]. CWL is an import format,
//! never the source of truth: only names and arity cross over (every behavior flag
//! stays default), so it widens completion and arity coverage without its
//! low-confidence data reaching a lexer/formatter/outline behavior decision. The
//! file is compiled into a `phf` perfect-hash map at build time (`build.rs`) and
//! `include!`-ed as read-only statics — zero runtime parse or decompress.
//!
//! **`compact-data` feature (opt-in, off by default):** trades that zero-parse
//! guarantee for a smaller binary, for embedders where size beats cold-start —
//! namely a long-lived host process where a one-time decompress+parse is free
//! in practice. `build.rs` then skips the phf bake and instead deflates the raw
//! JSON (`miniz_oxide::deflate`) into `$OUT_DIR/cwl_signatures.deflate` (~400 KB
//! → ~56 KB); [`cwl`] decompresses and [`parse`]s it once, lazily, into the same
//! [`SignatureDb`] the curated `signatures.json` tier already uses.
